*This is the stepwise procedure I will follow in making this project*

## Steps to be Followed:
 
### Creating a Personal Finance Management (PFM) website can be a great way to help individuals manage their finances. Integrating it with a payment app can make it even more convenient and user-friendly. Here are the steps you can follow to build your PFM website:

- Determine your goals and target audience: Before starting to build the website, it is important to understand what you want to achieve with it and who your target audience is. This will help you determine the features and functionality that you need to include in your PFM website.

- Choose a platform: There are several platforms you can use to build your PFM website, such as WordPress, Wix, or SquareSpace. Choose a platform that best fits your needs and budget.

- Design the website: Decide on the layout, color scheme, and overall look and feel of your PFM website. Make sure it is user-friendly and easy to navigate.

- Integrate with a payment app: Choose a payment app that supports integration with your PFM website and follow the instructions to integrate it into your website.

- Add features: Based on your goals and target audience, add features such as budgeting tools, investment tracking, bill reminders, and account syncing.

- Test and launch: Test the website thoroughly to make sure everything is working correctly and make any necessary changes. Launch the website and start promoting it to your target audience.

- Maintenance: Make sure to regularly update the website and add new features as needed to keep it relevant and useful for your users.

### Features We can add:

- Budgeting tools: Allow users to create and track their budgets, set savings goals, and see their spending habits over time.

- Investment tracking: Allow users to see the performance of their investments and portfolio, and compare it to benchmarks.

- Bill reminders: Send reminders to users about upcoming bills, so they never miss a payment.

- Account syncing: Automatically import transactions from financial institutions to the PFM website, so users can see all of their accounts in one place.

- Credit score tracking: Provide users with access to their credit scores and offer tips on how to improve them.

- Debt management: Help users create a plan to pay off their debt and track their progress over time.

- Savings and investment calculators: Offer calculators that help users estimate how much they need to save for retirement, or how much they can expect to earn from an investment.

- Financial education: Provide articles and resources to help users learn about personal finance and make informed decisions.

- Personalized recommendations: Based on a user's spending habits, suggest personalized budgeting and saving strategies.

- Mobile app: Develop a mobile app that syncs with the PFM website, so users can manage their finances on the go.
